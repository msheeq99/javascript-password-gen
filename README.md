ASK 03 -- Javascript Password Generator

for this assignment i had to make a password generator


I first started by declaring variables of numbers, lowercase alphabet, uppercase alphabet and special characters and put them in arrays.

I then made a function for generate password and used an IF statement for the prompt if password is less than 8 char or more than 128 char and if password is an empty string or NaN.

Then I added the confirm method so it returns true if i click on ok otherwise its false.

Then I made an empty array so that all my choices are concatted into one array with an if statement

Lastly I declared a variable called results and looped over the choices with a FOR loop and used math random and math floor to give me random choices
